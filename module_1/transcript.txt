The goal of this assignment is to provide students with foundational Python programming skills, enabling them to write clean, error-free code and build a strong base for integrating advanced features in the LLM-powered applications. Scenario: You are tasked with creating a basic utility for the Visa Mock Interview System (VMIS) that processes user data, validates inputs, and prepares it for further processing in a Flask-based application.

E
To create a basic utility for the Visa Mock Interview System (VMIS) that processes user data, validates inputs, and prepares it for further processing in a Flask-based application, follow these step-by-step instructions:

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Accept User Inputs:
Prompt the user to enter their name.
Prompt the user to enter their email address.
Prompt the user to enter their age.
2. Validate Inputs:
Name Validation:
Ensure the name contains only alphabetic characters.
If the name is invalid, display an appropriate error message.
Email Validation:
Check that the email address follows the standard email format (e.g., contains '@' and a domain).
If the email is invalid, display an appropriate error message.
Age Validation:
Ensure that the age is a positive integer.
If the age is invalid (non-numeric or negative), display an appropriate error message.
3. Print Validation Results:
Print a success message if all inputs are valid.
Print appropriate error messages if any input is invalid.
4. Classify Users Based on Age:
Check the user's age and classify them into one of the following categories:
Underage: Below 18 years
Adult: Between 18 and 60 years
Senior: Above 60 years
Print the user's category.
5. File Handling:
Saving User Data to File:
Open or create a file named user_data.txt.
Append the validated user data in the following format: Name: [name], Email: [email], Age: [age], Category: [category].
Ensure each new entry is appended without overwriting existing data.
6. Error Handling:
Invalid Input Handling:
Implement error handling for non-numeric values in age input.
File Operations Handling:
Implement error handling for file operations (e.g., file not found, permission issues).
7. Debugging with Logging:
Logging Setup:
Use Python’s logging module to track events and errors.
Logging User Validation Errors:
Log validation errors with appropriate messages.
Logging Successful Data Entries:
Log successful data entries with details.
Save logs to app_logs.txt.
8. Advanced Task (Optional):
Create a Menu-Driven Program:
Add a main menu with options:
Add New Entry: Allow users to input new data.
View All Entries: Display all saved entries from user_data.txt.
Exit: Gracefully exit the program.
9. Test Cases:
Prepare a file named test_cases.txt with at least 5 sample inputs and their expected outputs.
Test cases should cover valid and invalid scenarios for name, email, and age.
10. Documentation:
Create README.md with clear instructions on:
How to run the script.
Explanation of the script functionality.
Details about the output files (user_data.txt and app_logs.txt).
Provide setup information if any environment preparation is needed.
11. Submission:
Collect the Python script, user_data.txt, app_logs.txt, test_cases.txt, and README.md into a ZIP archive.
Optionally, host the project on GitHub and provide the repository link for submission.
Optimization Considerations:
Ensure all validations are efficiently handled to minimize performance overhead.
Use efficient file handling techniques to avoid unnecessary file operations.
Implement robust error handling to manage edge cases and prevent script crashes.
Utilize logging effectively to provide clear insights into script operations and issues.
Following these steps will guide you in creating a well-structured, clean, and error-free utility for VMIS, forming a solid foundation for further development and integration into a Flask-based application.

Advanced Task (Optional) Create a menu-driven program that allows users to: Add new entries. View all saved entries. Exit the program gracefully.

E
To create a menu-driven program that allows users to add new entries, view all saved entries, and exit the program gracefully, follow these step-by-step instructions:

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Menu Setup:
Display a main menu with the following options:
1. Add New Entry
2. View All Saved Entries
3. Exit
2. Menu Functionality:
Implement a loop that displays the menu and processes user choices until the user chooses to exit.
3. Add New Entry:
User Prompt:
Prompt the user to enter their name, email, and age.
Validation:
Validate all inputs as previously described:
Name: Validate it contains only alphabetic characters.
Email: Check for valid email format.
Age: Ensure it's a positive integer.
Display error messages for any invalid inputs and prompt the user to re-enter data until all are valid.
Classification:
Classify the user based on age into one of the categories: Underage, Adult, Senior.
Save to File:
Append the validated user data to user_data.txt.
Logging:
Log the successful addition of user data or any validation errors encountered.
4. View All Saved Entries:
File Reading:
Open user_data.txt in read mode.
Display Data:
Read and print the content of the file to display all saved user entries.
Error Handling:
Implement error handling for file operations (e.g., file not found, unable to read the file).
5. Exit the Program:
Graceful Exit:
Provide an option for the user to exit the program.
Ensure any open resources (like file handles) are properly closed before exiting.
6. Implementing the Menu-Driven Program:
Main Loop:
Keep the program running in a loop allowing the user to choose a menu option until 'Exit' is selected.
User Input Handling:
Handle menu selections with proper input validation to ensure valid menu option is chosen.
Optimization Considerations:
Ensure efficient file handling to minimize I/O operations and handle large file sizes gracefully.
Validate user inputs promptly to avoid unnecessary re-prompts and possible infinite loops.
Implement robust error handling to manage unexpected inputs and file access issues.
Utilize efficient loops and control structures to maintain optimal program performance, even under multiple iterations and varying data sizes.
Conclusion:
By implementing these steps, you will create a robust and user-friendly menu-driven program that allows users to add new entries, view all saved entries, and exit gracefully. This program will form a solid base for integrating advanced features and handling real-world scenarios efficiently.
