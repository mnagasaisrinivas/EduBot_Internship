# User Data Entry & Validation Script

This Python project is designed to accept user input (name, email, and age), validate it based on specific constraints, and log both valid entries and errors using Python's `logging` module.

## 🚀 Features

- Validates:
  - **Name** – Only alphabetical characters.
  - **Email** – Valid email format (e.g., user@example.com).
  - **Age** – Positive integers only.
- Logs:
  - Validation errors (logged as ERROR).
  - Successful data entries (logged as INFO).
  - Saves logs to a file at `./app_logs/app_logs.txt`.
